README
======

This is a student implementation of the memory allocator malloc as specified by
the ANSI/ISO standards.


How to build and run
--------------------

The included Makefile lets you build each test program simply by running `make
<test-program-name>`, where <test-program-name> is the name of the test program
source file WITHOUT any extension. Then it is simply a matter of executing the
resulting executable.

It is possible to easily switch between our own malloc implementation and the
one built-in to the system; by default our own malloc is linked with the test
cases; in order to use the one built-in to the system, just run `make
<test-program-name> MALLOC=` to reset the Makefile variable MALLOC, and thus
let the linker use the one included in your system.


Tests
-----

All source file names that starts with "tst" are assumed to be tests containing
a main() method, which performs the test(s).


Original README
===============

This directory contains a suite of seven tests to be used for checking your
implementation of malloc routines.

The file sysmalloc.o has been extracted from the the system's standard
library. You can compare the performance of your malloc implementation
against the system's one.

The Makefile can be used directly to compile and generate all seven
binaries. The name of your file should be "malloc.c". Note that
compilation is done using GNU's C compiler. You can also use any other
ANSI compiler.

The script RUN_TESTS runs all seven tests. Normally, a test should
take a few seconds to complete.

Have fun!
